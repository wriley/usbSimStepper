usbSimStepper
=============

This is a half-finished project I started several years ago for a flight simulator panel. It is a USB driver board
for 1-2 stepper motors built for instruments from Mike Powell's book Building Simulated Aircraft Instrumentation *1. Windows
programs, such as usbSimCentral *2, can interface with this board via a DLL *3.
