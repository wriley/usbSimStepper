usbSimStepper
=============

This is a half-finished project I started several years ago for a flight simulator panel. It is a USB driver board for 1-2 stepper motors built for instruments from Mike Powell's book Building Simulated Aircraft Instrumentation<sup>1</sup>. Windows programs, such as usbSimCentral<sup>2</sup>, can interface with this board via a DLL<sup>3</sup>.
